		<h2>who am i</h2>
		<blockquote>
				I 'am a computer enthusiast who loves experimenting and playing with computers. i had formally studied computer science and get a bachelor degree but never really worked in the field, never understand it. Two years ago i have decided to deeply understand computer science major using only internet as my first resource. through this journey i have learned many things, but most importantly two things:<br>
				First there are many problems that can be solved using computation.<br>
				Second you can learn anything by yourself.<br> i am still learning and the journey never ends. I decided to made this webpage in order to form a new community that shares the same passion 'playing with computers' and also supporting the exsiting community through sharing learning materials and posts about different topics that are interrelated in some way like 'Computer Science, Mathematics and Philosophy', Also it happened that i make a living playing with computers, so there will be a part in this webpage concerning busniess inquiries, our mailing list, and our contacts.
